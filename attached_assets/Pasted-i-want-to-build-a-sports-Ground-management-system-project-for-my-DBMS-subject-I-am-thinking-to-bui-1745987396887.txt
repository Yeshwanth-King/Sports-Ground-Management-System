i want to build a sports Ground management system project for my DBMS subject.
I am thinking to build it using django python. and i have a basic structure which i will give you now,

These describe the core actions the system must perform:

Ground Management

Admin can add, update, and delete sports ground details.

Each ground is associated with a specific sport (e.g., Football, Badminton).

Admin can view a list of all grounds along with their location and ratings.

Slot Management

Admin can add time slots for each ground (e.g., 6 AM to 7 AM).

Slots must have date, start time, end time, price, and availability status.

Admin can update slot prices and availability.

System must prevent double-booking of the same slot.

User Management

Users can register with personal details (name, email, phone, address).

Users can update their information.

System stores user booking history.

Booking System

Users can view available slots for a specific ground and date.

Users can book a slot.

Bookings have statuses: Confirmed, Cancelled, or Completed.

Users can cancel bookings before the slot time.

Payment Handling

Payments are linked to bookings.

Payment methods include Card, Cash, and Online.

Status of payment can be Paid, Pending, or Failed.

System calculates total amount based on slot price.

Reports & Queries

Admin can generate a revenue report per ground.

Admin can view booking statistics (e.g., occupancy rate).

Users can see their complete booking history.
